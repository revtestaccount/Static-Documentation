## Introduction

Revenue is making available a dedicated Public Interface Test (PIT) environment to enable payroll 
software developers verify the compatibility of their software packages with PAYE Modernisation 
changes. 

There are two PIT Environments available to software developers, the first PIT environment is a 
representation of the live environment with functionality kept up to date with the functionality 
currently available in the live environment. The second PIT environment is the PIT Next Version 
environment, which will contain upcoming functionality that is pertinent for developers to test their 
software ahead of the live release.

To support developers and testers through the PIT process, Revenue has provisioned a dedicated 
online PAYE PIT Help Desk.  By using the PAYE PIT Help Desk developers and testers can: 

- Notify Revenue of their interest in public interface testing 
- Raise and track ticketed queries 

This document provides a step by step guide to registering for the PAYE PIT Help Desk and 
subsequently using it to raise and track queries. 

Please note that images used throughout this document are broadly indicative of the final product 
but may be subject to change. 

## Prerequisites 

Logging into the PAYE PIT Help Desk is a two-step verification process requiring the interested 
developer/tester to have: 

- A valid email address 
- A smart device installed with Google Authenticator 

## PAYE PIT Help Desk Registration 

Interested developers/testers can register for the PAYE PIT Help Desk by completing a short online

*Figure 1 New User Registration screen*

The information supplied under the ‘Company/Business Name’ field will be used by Revenue to 
group users belonging to the same Business/Company together.  Users belonging to the same group 
will have access to each other’s queries raised through the PAYE PIT Help Desk1.   
For the purpose of assigning the user to the PAYE PIT Help Desk, PAYE Modernisation should be 
selected from the drop down for “System to be tested in PIT”. 
Upon successful completion of the form, the developer/tester will be asked to check the email 
address inputted on the form for further instructions. 
 
*As part of reviewing pending registrations Revenue will not associate a registration with a particular business/company group until it has verified that this is allowed by the business/company.*

folders if expected email has not arrived.

group and activating access to the Help Desk.
