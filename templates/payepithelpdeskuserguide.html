    <h2 class="pmod" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Revenue is making available a dedicated Public Interface Test (PIT) environment to enable payroll
        software developers verify the compatibility of their software packages with PAYE Modernisation
        changes. </p>
    <p>There are two PIT Environments available to software developers, the first PIT environment is a
        representation of the live environment with functionality kept up to date with the functionality
        currently available in the live environment. The second PIT environment is the PIT Next Version
        environment, which will contain upcoming functionality that is pertinent for developers to test their
        software ahead of the live release.</p>
    <p>To support developers and testers through the PIT process, Revenue has provisioned a dedicated
        online PAYE PIT Help Desk. By using the PAYE PIT Help Desk developers and testers can: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Notify Revenue of their interest in public interface testing </li>
        <li>Raise and track ticketed queries </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This document provides a step by step guide to registering for the PAYE PIT Help Desk and
        subsequently using it to raise and track queries. </p>
    <p>Please note that images used throughout this document are broadly indicative of the final product
        but may be subject to change. </p>
    <h2 class="pmod" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Logging into the PAYE PIT Help Desk is a two-step verification process requiring the interested
        developer/tester to have: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A valid email address </li>
        <li>A smart device installed with Google Authenticator </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="pmod" id="paye_pit_help_desk_registration">PAYE PIT Help Desk Registration</h2>
    <p>Interested developers/testers can register for the PAYE PIT Help Desk by completing a short online
        form available at the following URL: </p>
    <p><a
            href="https://revenuehelpdesk.canfigure.net/portal/revenueie/register.html">https://revenuehelpdesk.canfigure.net/portal/revenueie/register.html</a>
    </p>
    <p><img alt="Registration screen" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_11.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 1 New User Registration screen</em></p>
    <p>The information supplied under the ‘Company/Business Name’ field will be used by Revenue to
        group users belonging to the same Business/Company together. Users belonging to the same group
        will have access to each other’s queries raised through the PAYE PIT Help Desk1. <br />
        For the purpose of assigning the user to the PAYE PIT Help Desk, PAYE Modernisation should be
        selected from the drop down for “System to be tested in PIT”.
        Upon successful completion of the form, the developer/tester will be asked to check the email
        address inputted on the form for further instructions. </p>
    <p><em>As part of reviewing pending registrations Revenue will not associate a registration with a particular
            business/company group until it has verified that this is allowed by the business/company.</em></p>
    <p><img alt="Registration Successful" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_13.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 2 Registration Successful</em></p>
    <p>The email instructs the developer/tester to verify their email address through clicking on the
        supplied link.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Email clients may treat an initial email from the Help Desk as spam so please check spam
        folders if expected email has not arrived. </p>
    <p><img alt="Email Verification" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_15.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 3 Email Verification</em></p>
    <p>Clicking on the link will present the developer/tester with the following message: </p>
    <p><img alt="Email successfully verified" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_16.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 4 Email successfully verified</em></p>
    <p>At this point in the process Revenue will be alerted of the registration request and will review the
        supplied registration details before associating the registration with the specified company/business
        group and activating access to the Help Desk.</p>
    <p>The developer/tester will be notified of successful registration by email which will include
        instructions on how to complete the process and log in to the Help Desk:</p>

    <h2 class="pmod" id="raising_and_tracking_queries">Raising and Tracking Queries</h2>
    <p>To raise a PIT related query the developer/tester must first log into the Help Desk using the email
        address specified at registration time and the associated code from Google Authenticator </p>

    <p><img alt="PAYE PIT Helpdesk Dashboard" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_23.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 8 PAYE PIT Helpdesk Dashboard</em></p>
    <p>The developer/tester can raise a new query by clicking on the ‘New Ticket’ icon available in the left
        hand bar.</p>

    <p><img alt="Raising a query" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_24.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 9 Raising a query</em></p>

        for tracking purposes: </p>
    <p><img alt="Email receipt" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_26.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 10 Email receipt</em></p>

    <p><em>Figure 11 My Open Tickets</em></p>
    <p>The developer/tester will only be able to see tickets raised by themselves and those tickets
        associated with their company/business group.</p>
    <p>On resolution of the query or if further information is required, the developer/tester will receive an
        email notification with the details: </p>
    <p><img alt="Resolution notification email" src="./templates/payepithelpdeskuserguide/image_31.png" /></p>
    <p><em>Figure 12 Resolution notification email</em></p>
