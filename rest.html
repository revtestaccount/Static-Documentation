        documentation, specification, and examples for the above web services which has been made available

    </p>

    <p>This document assumes familiarity with the XML web services above. A full description of each of
        these
        can be found in the Web Service Overview Document under ‘PAYE Web Service Examples’ on the
        Documents Homepage. The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) files for the above web services
        can be found under ‘PAYE Web Service Specifications’.</p>

    <p>WSDL is a W3C standard for describing web services. Further details of each web service can be found
        in
        the supporting WSDL file. Each file references the necessary schemas and indicates the URL where the
        services may be accessed. The URL for each web service will use the HTTPS protocol to ensure the
        privacy of all communication between ROS and the web service client.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">2. Calling the Services</h3>
    <p>The web services for the PAYE Modernisation messages are described through WSDL files and the
        schema for each message.
        Further details of the web services can be found in the published PAYE Modernisation WSDL files.
        The WSDL, SOAP and WS Security version specifications we are following include:
        WSDL 1.2: WSDL 1.2
        SOAP 1.2: SOAP 1.2
        WS Security 1.1.1: WS Security 1.1.1
        The SOAP Header must include a Content-Type of application/soap+xml.
