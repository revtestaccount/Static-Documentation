<h2 class="document-title">1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide to use the PIT Self Service Application.  This application 
provides developers and testers access to exclusive Revenue generated test data that is supported in the PIT 
environment. </p>
<p>By using this application developers/testers can: 
- Download digital certificates associated with test employers required for conformance testing<br/>
- Download JSON files containing data of the test employees associated with each test employer 
- Request additional certificates for testing 
- Delete test employer data 
- Create a test unemployed customer 
- Download test agent certificates with a test employer </p>
<p>Each employer subsequently created in each environment exists only in that environment. Employers in the PIT 
current version environment will have a registration number of 8XXXXXXXH and the cert associated with them 
will be of the form 9999XXXXX. In the PIT next version environment, employers will have a registration number 
of 9XXXXXXXH and the cert associated with them will be of the form 8888XXXXX.  </p>
<p>The PIT Self Service Application can be accessed at the following URL:<br/>

<h3>1.1 Prerequisites</h3>
<p>In order to access and use the PIT Self Service Application, you need to have completed the registration process 
for the PAYE Modernisation PIT Help Desk  and indicated that you require access to PAYE Modernisation testing. 
On completion of the registration process, you will receive a digital certificate and password which will allow 
access to the PIT self service application.</p>
<h2 class="document-title">2 LOGGING IN</h2>
<p>The login screen requires users to sign in with their Test Data Management (TDM) digital certificate and 
password provided during the registration process1.<br/>
In order to make the digital certificate that was issued as part of the PIT registration process available in the 
‘Select Certificate’ drop down menu, it needs to be loaded into the web browser. The ‘Manage My Certificates’ 
link provides a screen that allows users to select the certificate and load it into the web browser. </p>

<p>Please note that this login screen is shared with the ROS Payroll reporting screens. User’s will be directed to the PIT 
Self Service application from this login screen if they use the Test Data Management (TDM) digital certificate/password 
provided as part of PIT registration. However, if they use digital certificates provided by the PIT Self Service application 
they will be directed to the ROS Payroll Reporting screens. </p>
